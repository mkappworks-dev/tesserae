# 23: The UI matches the prototype

Status: ready-for-agent

Blocked by: 03, 04, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19

Spec: [Phase 15](../spec.md).

## What to build

Every screen this spec added or restyled matches the approved prototype one to one: theme, colours, fonts and weights, sizes, spacing, layout, borders and radii, states (hover, focus, selected, disabled) and copy. The screens are the title screen, Worlds, Mods, Create World (World, Mods, Biomes, Review), Edit World, the in-game Menu, Settings in every category, the Inventory with the Catalogue, the HUD (hotbar, held item name, vitals tiles, pickup feed, notice card) and the death screen. Each engine screen is compared with the same prototype route at the same window size, from a dev screenshot of the engine beside a browser screenshot of the prototype. Where the engine cannot do what the CSS does (a backdrop blur, a font feature), the closest engine equivalent is used and recorded in this ticket. The prototype's own chrome (the prototype bar, the Simulate panel, the Scores link) is not part of the design.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Every listed screen has a side-by-side engine and prototype screenshot at the same size, and each difference is fixed or recorded here with its reason.
- [ ] Colours, fonts and spacing come from shared theme values, not per-screen literals.
- [ ] Every screen keeps its existing tests green.

## Comments

- Maintainer, 2026-11-06: the menus' theme, colours, fonts and layout do not yet match the mockups one to one.
